This condo has a beautifully renovated kitchen with new cabinets, premium counter top, and stainless steel appliances.  This unit has a properly vented dryer and washer in the unit.  The bathroom has been renovated with a subway tile shower/bathtub surround, new flooring, and a new vanity.  Hanover Circle is located in beautiful, historic Highland Park on Hanover Circle. Highland Park has been designated a ""Top 10 American Neighborhoods"" by the American Planning Association. Highland Park has been singled out by the prestigious organization for its distinctive public spaces, mix of land uses and housing options, its picturesque setting and strategic location, all of which have attracted families and individuals for generations.   Hanover is a gated community with the feel and look of the old Coastal South. With charming wrought iron, Bevolo gas lanterns, hurricane shutters and plantation doors, you will be reminded of Pensacola's Seville Quarter, Mobile's Spring Hill district or New Orleans' French Quarter, especially as you are greeted as you come and go by the grand Provincial fountain. The grounds are appointed with over 6 varieties of palms complimenting the ""Old Quarter"" feel.   Hanover's common areas are without comparison! Swim in Hanover's newly renovated saltwater pool. Pool deck has been totally renovated and decorated with exquisite naturally quarried travertine tile in classic herringbone pattern. Enjoy free access to Hanover's ample workout room as well. The property has spacious onsite parking inside the gated area. Many properties in the area have no private parking but at Hanover there is no need to fight for parking on the street!! The complex has a new digital security camera system. Additionally, the street on which the property is located (Hanover Circle) is within St. Vincent Hospital's security perimeter and is patrolled by St. Vincent security. Water, garbage, recycling and pest control are included. Cats allowed with a fee. Hanover Circle Condominium is a smoke-free property!  Pet friendly, but the condo association restricts dog breeds and weight to 25 pounds or less.  I want it to open back up in the summer, so the first lease could be around six months and then on 12 month terms.",33.5068,-86.7872,al
